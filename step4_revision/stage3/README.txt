# Here, we will generate random labels for all segments (for CNN-rnd) and random labels for the selected for revision segments only (CNN-rrnd)

# The order of script execution is indicated with prefix step#_

# data/ folder stores output of the main scripts
 
# step1_randomize_allsegments.py - labels of all segments in the SPACE/BAMBI dataset will be shuffled
# step2_randomize_selected_segments.py - labels of the selected for revision segments only in the SPACE/BAMBI dataset will be shuffled
